## 🚀 About Me
I’m a dedicated Computer Engineering & Computer Sciences student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, deeply passionate about AI and Machine Learning — especially artificial vision and building ML systems that make a real-world impact.

**🔧 Highlights from my journey in tech so far:**

- 👁️ IRIS @ COMPUTE LAB - implementing neuromorphic vision algorithms in C on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC (AUP ZU3 FPGA), replicating retinal circuits for motion and looming detection. Designing and testing FPGA-based logic for real-time drone vision acceleration, integrating low-level embedded programming with biologically inspired computer vision models to enable low-power, event-driven perception. 

- 📊 Data Engineering Intern @ West Bend Insurance - migrated 130+ years of policy data to Snowflake, built automated QA pipelines, and boosted ML prediction accuracy by 50% using XGBoost on 134k+ records. 

- 🚀 Avionics Engineer @ Wisconsin Space Program - designed a safety-critical Engine Control Unit (ECU) for a reusable liquid rocket, deployed fault-tolerant embedded C++ firmware, and led system integration across 90+ members. 

- 🚘 Research Intern @ Inspirit AI - developed and verified a neural-network-based vehicle detection model for autonomous perception under a Harvard PhD mentor, achieving 95% training and 72% test accuracy.

- 📧 emailgist (Personal Project) - built an AI email summarization platform fine-tuned on 500K+ business emails using BART/T5, with a full-stack deployment via FastAPI + React, reducing email length by ~60% while preserving key action items. 

**When I'm not building, you'll find me:**

- ⚽ Playing soccer with friends (my favorite way to unwind!)
- 🛍️ Thrifting for unique fashion finds and exploring new styles
- 🍜 Grabbing amazing eats with friends and discovering new restaurants
- 🏕️ Camping and exploring the outdoors (nature is my reset button!)
- ✈️ Traveling to new places and meeting incredible people along the way
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Spending quality time with family — they're my foundation, my biggest support, and my daily inspiration

I'm deeply proud of my ଓଡ଼ିଆ (Odia) heritage 🇮🇳 and love sharing the incredible food, vibrant traditions, and rich culture of Odisha with friends. Whether I'm playing soccer to unwind, thrifting for fashion gems, or discovering amazing local eats, I'm always looking for new ways to connect with people and explore the world around me. Family is my anchor, and I cherish every moment spent with my parents—our shared values and roots drive everything I do. I find joy and inspiration in nature, travel, and meaningful conversations, and I stay actively involved in my communities through the Indian Student Association (ISA) and local volunteering. For me, life is about learning, building, and giving back—always with curiosity, creativity, and heart.

**Feel free to reach out! I’m always excited to learn, collaborate, and build something meaningful together.**
