## 🚀 About Me
I’m a dedicated Computer Engineering & Computer Sciences student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, deeply passionate about AI and Machine Learning — especially artificial vision and building ML systems that make a real-world impact.

**🔧 Highlights from my journey in tech so far:**
- Developed embedded firmware for rocket avionics, enhancing real-time control and safety
- Built and maintained SQL + Snowflake pipelines powering critical business operations
- Trained YOLO-based object detection models for autonomous vehicle research
- Conducted space sustainability research under a Harvard PhD mentor, exploring rocket emission impacts

**When I'm not building safety-critical rocket avionics or optimizing enterprise data pipelines, you'll find me:**

- ⚽ Playing soccer with friends (my favorite way to unwind!)
- 🛍️ Thrifting for unique fashion finds and exploring new styles
- 🍜 Grabbing amazing eats with friends and discovering new restaurants
- 🏕️ Camping and exploring the outdoors (nature is my reset button!)
- ✈️ Traveling to new places and meeting incredible people along the way
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Spending quality time with family — they're my foundation, my biggest support, and my daily inspiration

I'm deeply proud of my ଓଡ଼ିଆ (Odia) heritage 🇮🇳 and love sharing the incredible food, vibrant traditions, and rich culture of Odisha with friends. Whether I'm playing soccer to unwind, thrifting for fashion gems, or discovering amazing local eats, I'm always looking for new ways to connect with people and explore the world around me. Family is my anchor, and I cherish every moment spent with my parents—our shared values and roots drive everything I do. I find joy and inspiration in nature, travel, and meaningful conversations, and I stay actively involved in my communities through the Indian Student Association (ISA) and local volunteering. For me, life is about learning, building, and giving back—always with curiosity, creativity, and heart.

**Feel free to reach out! I’m always excited to learn, collaborate, and build something meaningful together.**
